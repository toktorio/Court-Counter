Simple score keeper app which can be used to keep track of the score of two different teams playing basketball.

*This app is created as the second project of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) program at Udacity.*

### Features
- Keep track of the score of two different teams who are playing in a basketball match.
- Simple and straightforward design to make it easy for any user to use the app.
- Design support for both portrait and landscape orientation.

### What I have learned from this project
- Adding multiple buttons into the app.
- Updating views with new data on every button clicks.
- Properly scoping variables (local or global).
- Finding views by their ID using Java code.
